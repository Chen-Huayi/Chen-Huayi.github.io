### *Prerequisites*
+ You will work with popular and current technical documentation tools. The most important thing is **GitHub Pages**. It allows you to make and upload your resume on the website.  
+ You required a basic level for writing **Markdown** language, I will talk about benefits of this language later.  
+ I recommend you write and edit codes by using a **Markdown editor**. Of course, it depends on you, you can directly write Markdown on GitHub files or anywhere you like.  
+ If you want to make your resume more vivid in order to leave a nice first impression on employers, **Jekyll** is the best choice.
